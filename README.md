# Machine Learning from Scratch

Building ML foundations by implementing algorithms from first principles.

## Projects

### 1. Linear Regression
- **Cost Function**: Implemented Mean Squared Error
- **Visualization**: U-curve showing optimization landscape
- **Gradient Descent**: Coded the optimization algorithm from scratch
- **Result**: Successfully converged from slope=0 to optimal slope≈11

**Key Skills**: NumPy, Matplotlib, Understanding gradient descent mathematics
